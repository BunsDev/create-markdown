# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Adding a Changeset

To add a changeset, run:

```bash
bun changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose the semver bump type (major, minor, patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

## Releasing

When ready to release:

```bash
bun version-packages  # Updates versions and changelogs
bun release           # Publishes to npm
```
